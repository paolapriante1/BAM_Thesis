This repository contains the pre-processing files as well as the code to run the models used for both types of analysis in my Thesis. 
Note that part of the pre-processing was done using excel and the R files include only part of the pre-processing. 
1. Dataprepcontractual.R: Pre-processing for the dataset used in the contractual setting.
2. Processed_dataset.RData: The file containing the dataset ready for analysis.
3. Final_contractual.Rmd: The file containing the Logistic regression and random forest analysis.
4. Datapreplatentattrition.R The file containing the preprocessing for the non-contractual analysis.
5. Covariates.RData: The file containing the covariates dataset ready for analysis in the non-contractual setting.
6. Transactions.RData: The file containing the transactions dataset reade for the analysis in the non-contracual setting. 
7. Final_non_contractual.Rmd: The file containing the Standard Pareto/NBD and the Extended Pareto/NBD model.
